This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

1. Clone the git URL in any folder on the system: 
    a. Right click on the desired folder and select "Git Bash Here". 
    b. Paste the below command in the terminal which gets opened: 
    git clone https://github.com/aksharabhat/spaceX-launch-program.git
2. In the same terminal go to the directory created: "cd spaceX-launch-program"
3. Checkout to master branch as the code stays in master branch: "git checkout master"
4. Install all dependencies: "npm install"
5. Install next as the code is written using NEXT.js: "npm install next react react-dom"
6. Run either of the commands to start the server: "npm run dev" / "npm start"

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
